# ShitPT, its shit!
# GPT Content Reviewer

The GPT Content Reviewer is a Python script that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and code-davinci-002 models to help you plan, consolidate context, and execute coding tasks. It fetches the context from a Git repository and passes it to the coders to generate the required code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- openai Python package
- python-docx package
- openpyxl package
- pandas package
- GitPython package
- base256 package

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install openai python-docx openpyxl pandas GitPython base256
```

### Usage

1. Set your OpenAI API key in the script:

```python
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key_here'
```

2. Customize the `local_repo_directory`, `planning_question`, and `task_description` variables in the `main()` function:

```python
local_repo_directory = '/path/to/your/local/repository'
planning_question = "your_planning_question_here"
task_description = "your_coding_task_description_here"
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python gpt_content_reviewer.py
```

The script will perform the following steps:

1. Plan with GPT: Send your planning question to GPT-3.5-turbo and receive a planning result.
2. Consolidate context from the repository: Fetch the context from the local Git repository and consolidate it.
3. Execute the coding task with the context: Send the task description and context to code-davinci-002 to generate the required code.

The generated code will be printed on the console.
